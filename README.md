All listeners functions are defined inside `dappHero` object.

For example to listen after a contract method result it's outputed to the DOM you can simple call:

```javascript
dappHero.listenToContractOutputChange(event => {
   console.log(`Event changed`, event)
})
```

#### Supported events currently are for:

- [x] Custom Contract
- [ ] Network
- [ ] NFT
- [ ] ThreeBox
- [ ] User


### E2E Testing

E2E_METAMASK_ADDRESS=
E2E_METAMASK_PASSWORD=
```

2. Run the following commands:

```sh
